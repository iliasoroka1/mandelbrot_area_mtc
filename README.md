## Introduction

This project focuses on the estimation of the Mandelbrot set area, a classic problem in computational mathematics and fractal geometry. The Mandelbrot set, named after mathematician Beno√Æt Mandelbrot, is a complex and visually striking set of points that shows that simple rules can create complex structures.

## Methodology

The project employs various sampling techniques within the Monte Carlo framework. Each technique offers a unique approach to sampling, influencing both the accuracy and efficiency of the estimation process. The techniques used include:

- **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHC)**

- **Orthogonal Sampling**

- **Stratified Sampling**

- **Pure Random Sampling**

- **Antithetic Variates**
